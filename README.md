# LeftAndRight
A simple game in which the player must indicate which color the square has changed to, by pressing left and right arrow, or "a" and "d". 

To play the game, simply extract the file "LeftAndRightActualGame"  to a folder of your choice and run the .exe file.

The file "LeftAndRightUnityGameFiles" is a Unity project that can be added to Unity Hub.

The music "Monplaisir - Garage" is not by me, but by Monplaisir.
